## üèÅ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aj-water-solutions.git
cd aj-water-solutions
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Here‚Äôs a sample structure:

```env
# MongoDB connection string (Atlas or localhost)
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/ajws?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Session secret for express-session
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

# JWT secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret

# Email credentials for nodemailer (for OTP and notifications)
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password

# Port
PORT=5500
```

> **Disclaimer:**
> Before using email features (OTP, notifications), make sure your Gmail or any email service is properly configured to work with Nodemailer. Refer to the [Nodemailer documentation](https://nodemailer.com/usage/) for required settings (such as enabling app passwords, allowing less secure apps, or OAuth2 setup) to avoid authentication errors.


### 4. Restore Sample Data

If you want to populate your database with sample data (products, users, etc.), use the provided BSON files in `db-backup/AJWS/`.

#### **Using mongorestore:**

**For MongoDB Atlas:**
```bash
mongorestore --uri="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/ajws" --dir="db-backup/AJWS"
```

**For Localhost:**
```bash
mongorestore --db ajws --dir="db-backup/AJWS"
```

> Replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB credentials.

### 5. Run the Project

```bash
node app.js
```

The app will be available at [http://localhost:5500](http://localhost:5500) (or your specified port).
